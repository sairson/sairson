<b>Hey 👋, I'm SaiRson - I gave the name a special meaning, but now I've forgotten it</b>

<h4> about me </h4>
<h4>· 😇 Professional student <h4>
<h4>· 😀 Penetration tester </h4>

## I'm a college student, but I'm also a fan of penetration testing and red team research. Github is a place for me to learn and improve, where I meet a lot of technical people and learn their code and techniques to improve myself
  
## notice Many of the projects are fork, please go back to me by the blue team masters, please detour (I only use it for learning)  

## notice hw 若溯到我的工具，提前说明，我不参加，别溯
