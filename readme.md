<b>Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm SaiRson - I gave the name a special meaning, but now I've forgotten it</b>

<h4> about me </h4>
<h4>Â· ðŸ˜‡ Professional student <h4>
<h4>Â· ðŸ˜€ Penetration tester </h4>
<h4>. ðŸ˜Š The code people who make weapons for the Red team </h4>

## I'm a college student, but I'm also a fan of penetration testing and red team research. Github is a place for me to learn and improve, where I meet a lot of technical people and learn their code and techniques to improve myself

## Next few little plans

1. Implement Loadlibrary with Go and use it as a library

2. Complete the Web scanner you use

3. Complete the weaponized C2 for your own use and as a course design
