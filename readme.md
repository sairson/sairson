<b>Hey ğŸ‘‹, I'm SaiRson - I gave the name a special meaning, but now I've forgotten it</b>

<h4> about me </h4>
<h4>Â· ğŸ˜‡ Professional student <h4>
<h4>Â· ğŸ˜€ Penetration tester </h4>
<h4>. ğŸ˜Š The code people who make weapons for the Red team </h4>
<h4>. ğŸ˜† Independently developed

## I'm a college student, but I'm also a fan of penetration testing and red team research. Github is a place for me to learn and improve, where I meet a lot of technical people and learn their code and techniques to improve myself

## Next few little plans

1. Complete the Web scanner you use

2. Update and maintain the completed basic C2 framework

3. Complete an Internet asset/vulnerability scan with the workflow scanner
